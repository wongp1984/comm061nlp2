### COMM061 NLP Course Project

This repository contains the code for the coursework of COMM061 NLP module. The project contains two parts, the first is the [individual work](https://github.com/wongp1984/comm061nlp2/tree/master/IndividualCoursework), in which each team member perform their own work to compare different text feature extratction methods and build their own ML models in emotion labelling. In the group work, a simple webapp is created which takes an input text and using the best performing model to label its emotions. 


#### Individual Coursework
The jupyter notebooks elaborating the experimentation results can be found in [individual work](https://github.com/wongp1984/comm061nlp2/tree/master/IndividualCoursework).

#### Groupwork
The [run_app.ipynb](https://github.com/wongp1984/comm061nlp2/blob/master/run_app.ipynb) will lanuch a simple webapp using Flask, which in the backend will call the ML model to predict the emotion labels and an input text.
